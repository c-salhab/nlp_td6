When a wealthy businessman offers Cobb a chance to clear his criminal record, he is asked to do the opposite of a typical \u201cextraction\u201d: he must *plant* a thought in the target\u2019s subconscious\u2014a process called **inception**.\n\nTo accomplish this, Cobb assembles a crew of experts (Robert Fischer\u2019s heir, a \u201cdream architect\u201d, a forger, a chemist, etc.) and creates a multi\u2011layered dream structure. They descend several levels of dream time, each with its own rules and dangers, all while being pursued by the target\u2019s subconscious defenses and by Cobb\u2019s own guilt over the loss of his wife. The climax hinges on the characters\u2019 ability to keep their shared dream stable long enough to implant the idea, while Cobb confronts the ultimate question of what is real and what remains a dream. The film ends ambiguously, leaving viewers unsure whether Cobb has returned to the waking world or is still in a dream.","Inception follows Dom Cobb, a thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious, as he is hired to plant an idea into a target's mind.",0.7962837219,true],["What company produced Inception?","Inception was produced by **Warner\u202fBros.
